Only way I see for him to have any chances to win is to play aggressively, in Fad\'s style, doing a lot of damage in short amount of time :) this is risky tho, but just waiting and looking how the opponents destroys you is much worse.

I can\'t forget 5 kills in 1st move, when all guys can think about 2 or max 3 worms. Anyway everything is almost impossible against the complite tactic\/skills\/concentration and vision of the game, which Dario has.","preview":"","created":"2011-11-22 13:34:21","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},{"game_id":"948","user_id":26,"message":"Congrats Dario for win ,silver a very good result Koras gj too :)","preview":"","created":"2011-11-22 17:21:10","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},{"game_id":"948","user_id":"13","message":"haha yeah WM, it was against SuperPippo and his &quot;how I suppose to win now?!&quot;\nI agree, SirGorash is one of greatest wormers without any medal in history of this turney.","preview":"","created":"2011-11-22 23:05:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},{"game_id":"948","user_id":"5","message":"This game was all about concentration. Koras was playing awesome at the start but then he was too pressed with all his  opponents &quot;greatness&quot; lol. If Koras continued playing his way he had chances to win it. But he preffered to chat, listen and react on streaming and all that irrelevant bullshit. So as a result he lost. Agree with Zolo here. SirG would most probably pwn in this one but unfortunately he is busy with RL stuff now.","preview":"","created":"2011-11-23 08:04:08","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},{"game_id":"948","user_id":"37","message":"That\'s my comment Khamski lol :)","preview":"","created":"2011-11-23 14:34:32","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},{"game_id":"948","user_id":"5","message":"You\'ve made three comments and none of them looks like mine lol. )) Or you are talking about the 4th one that you were about to write? :P\n","preview":"","created":"2011-11-23 14:52:24","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},{"game_id":"948","user_id":"8","message":"Congratulations to all that has played this awesome tourney, but specialy to Mablak, Koras and, of course, Dario!
