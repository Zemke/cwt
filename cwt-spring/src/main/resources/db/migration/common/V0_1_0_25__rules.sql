update configuration set value='# Spirit of CWT

First of all, the rules listed below can’t cover every possible problem. Crespo’s Worms Tournament thrives on its good atmosphere. So every participant is commanded to respect his opponent and find a solution for any given problem by means of discussion. If a problem occurs, please take responsibility to come to an agreement with your opponent, using the rules as a guideline. In case of a conflict, the admin team will determine the solution.

## Sign up
Once the applications have opened you can apply to take part in CWT. Any number of contestants may apply for participation in the upcoming tournament. \
After all, 32 will be selected by the administrators to take part. There could also be qualifiers.

## Issues

### Internet disconnections

How could you lessen the issues with Internet disconnections?

If you have your game joined by a third-party spectator, he will know who disconnected. There’s no other way of knowing.

### Your opponent is unresponsive

Contact an admin early on. If they see that you’re engaged in playing your game, you will win by admins’ decision or your opponent will be disqualified and might be replaced by somebody on thew waiting list.

The chat on the home page is the best way for you to arrange games with your opponent. Write `@OpponentName` to write a private message to your opponent. \
**Admins can read all private messages** and any user might eventually become an admin. This allows admins to see your effort in arranging the game.

### In-game rules

We follow [Open Normal League rules](http://www.normalnonoobs.com/rules).

### Inactive players

You may only sign up if the coming two or three months have enough spare time for you to play your games.

During group stage inactive players may be replaced and their games voided. In playoffs their could be technical wins or assuming it’s the first round of the playoffs they may be replaced.

## Tournament

Mostly you will see eight groups, four opponents per group and the first two advancing into playoffs. In reality, the numbers may be different but it will be very visible for you if you visit the groups page.

Currently CWT is played best of five except for the finals (little final and final) which are best of seven.

### Group stage points pattern

3-0; 3 points for the winner, 0 points for the loser
3-1; 3 points for the winner, 0 points for the loser
3-2; 3 points for the winner, 1 point for the loser

### Group draw

Admins apply a subjective ranking and divide the players into four categories with each group getting one player of each subjective strength rating.

### Playoffs draw

Place one of the group stage will play against another group’s second place. From then on there’s a typical playoff tree.

## Live Streams

We’re always happy to see people live stream games of CWT. Experience has shown that the following rules make sense.

- Participants are prohibited from watching or listening to streams of their own games while playing
- Participants are prohibited from live streaming their own games
- Participants don’t have the power and are also not allowed to keep their games from being live streamed

If you can set up a slight delay in your live stream it would be appreciated. That way the opponents cannot derive any knowledge from the live stream that is normally not available to them in-game (i.e. rope stock).
